// So I am not sure if I want to escalate errors from underlying implementation (LSP most likely)
//  or just provide some generic "check health" status, that would trigger a reload when LSP dies.
// The latter seems cleaner than just escalating all results to be what, handled, ignored in UI?

// Yeah, I get this feeling more and more. It's a programmers' move to deliver results of both
//  successful and failed calls to the same place, which results in terrible UX.
// A successful navcomp call results in options available to user.
// Failed navcomp calls should lead to logs, automated restart of underlying service, and if problem
//  persists a tiny tiny warning to the user "hey, this shit is so broken I can't cope with it".
//
// Bottom line, if your UX designer comes up with a popup
//                                                        then you should fire your UX designer.
// Programmers are allowed to make such mistakes. Look on how we dress and ask yourself: "would
//  I take esthetics advice from this person?"

// Also, I am tired of making boilerplate code here between LSP and "other navcomps", that I am not
//  sure will ever exist. But then I recall that without it, I'd be exposed to whatever becomes of
//  LSP in the future.
