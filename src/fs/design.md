So I was super unhappy about my design of FF and FSF, but it seems live VFS crate does exactly the same. So I'll fly
with it for a while, but I won't integrate the other crate to my project just yet.

But now I think I want the paths to be "shared" like ref-counted one directional lists...

... I don't know, I want to get to LSP now!
