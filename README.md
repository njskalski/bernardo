The up-to-date version is at [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/njskalski/bernardo).

This is a repository currently hosting two projects:

- [Bernardo](docs/bernardo_tui/index.md) is a TUI widget library.

- [Gladius](docs/gladius/index.md) is a code editor.

Currently they are developed in single repo, because separating them at this time would hinder the effort.

Furthermore *both projects are in alpha state*, they *will* crash, don't use them for anything important yet.

Licenses: [GPLv3](COPYRIGHT). I might re-release Bernardo as [LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) at
later date, but that has not been decided yet.
If you decide to contribute, be sure you are OK with that. That's the only "CLA" required. However, the text editor
widget will remain GPLv3 without 'L'.

Here is a website describing reasoning behind the projects: [Triarii](https://njskalski.gitlab.io/triarii)

Inspiration for name:

[Bernardo Gui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Gui), an inquisitor, historian and for a period of time, Bishop of
Tui :D. Portrayed as violent, unfair man in
"The Name of the Rose" novel by Umberto Eco. Some sources claim that this image is overly negative. I consider using
mouse for programming a heresy, so I figured I need a help from professional inquisition that no one expects.
