In order to handle page-up, page-down events in say List widget, I need to know the part of list that is displayed.
This is tricky, because Size is not part of the widgets right now. The quickest solution would be to add Cell<XY>
to widget.size(max_size : XY) and be gone with it, or make "size(&mut self)", but that's storing last frame
state in widgets.

Much clearer way was suggested by React library (and followed by tui-react) is to separate widget state (state)
from parent arguments (props?). I don't implement props as such, but output size definitely seems like one.

I think I will extend the InputEvent with information about output size, and maybe focus path, though I can hardly
think of a reason why a widget should care. But whether it was focused or not (in case we're handling tick)? Now
I am assuming that a non-focused widget cannot receive input.

In a way, input is always in context of most recently drawn frame (currently presented to user).
