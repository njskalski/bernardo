Menu widget:

for navigational menus

This widget requires a rethink. In particular, I think I'd like something like
   _________________
  |picked option:   |
  |  _________________
  | |  suboption 1
  | |[ suboption 2 ]
  --|
    |

this might also be just a layout.

Search widget:

search widget should be a "tree", that is common prefixes should collapse into a single node.
