There is a decision to make, what is the minimal change that justifies having a undo-option. Now I just do it every char.
That's probably overkill.

And then, if I undo, then edit, I need to clear redo-list (called forward_history). This can be done TO buffer object
or BY buffer object.

The question is: should editor (widget) OR the buffer itself decide, when establish the milestones.

I guess pushing it to buffer state is cleaner than keeping it in widget.
