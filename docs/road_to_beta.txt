Here is what I want to be present in Gladius Beta:

1) code navigation (go to definition, see usages)
2) full text search (aka ctrl-shift-f)
3) the context menu
4) git filtering in file search
5) fuzzy file search covered with tests

Nice to haves (only if they turn out to be low hanging fruits):
1) guessing programming language from code
2) user-focus-path (aka bookmark stack)
3) tumblerview
4) errors/warnings in editor

Docs:
1) how views work
2) how main loop works
3) how filesystems are implemented
