Here is what I want to be present in Gladius Beta:

1) code navigation (go to definition, see usages)
2) full text search (aka ctrl-shift-f)
  these two almost beg for "results view"
3) the context menu
4) git filtering in file search
5) fuzzy file search covered with tests
6) [DONE] code formatting
7) Editor "labels" (in-code overlay-"comments", clearly distingushible messages noting errors/warnings)
8) Code "collapsing"

prequisites:
fix definition and documentation of min_size (there's a TODO there)

Nice to haves (only if they turn out to be low hanging fruits):
1) guessing programming language from code
2) user-focus-path (aka bookmark stack)
3) tumblerview
4) errors/warnings in editor
9) copy-cut-paste in filetree
    

Docs:
1) how views work
2) how main loop works
3) how filesystems are implemented

TODOs:
- support resize event (start in crossterm_input.rs)
- support paste event too?
