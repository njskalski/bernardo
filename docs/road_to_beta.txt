What I am working on right now:
- I am trying to get the "code results widget" to display anything

Here is what I want to be present in Gladius Beta:

1) code navigation ( go to definition)
2) full text search (aka ctrl-shift-f)
  these two almost beg for "results view"
2.5) make the buffer states globally tracked, not two different buffer states for same file. But cursors are not part of that state.
2... furthermore, navcomp op is pretty much always the same. If old navcomp
2.75) add a Trait to do "check_invariant";
3) the context menu
4) git filtering in file search
5) fuzzy file search covered with tests
6) Editor "labels" (in-code overlay-"comments", clearly distingushible messages noting errors/warnings)
7) Code "collapsing"

Nice to haves (only if they turn out to be low hanging fruits):
1) guessing programming language from code
2) user-focus-path (aka bookmark stack)
3) tumblerview
4) errors/warnings in editor
9) copy-cut-paste in filetree

Tests:
save as:
    - error handling in save (failed write, disappearing dir etc)
    - changes the path to new in consecutive save as

Docs:
1) how views work
2) how main loop works
3) how filesystems are implemented

TODOs:
- support resize event (start in crossterm_input.rs)
- support paste event too?


DONE:
- see usages
- code formatting
