Project is way too big to be written by a single person, yet it is. So writing tests is completely beyond possibility,
yet necessary. So how do I get around it?

I'll create a framework to quickly devise 90% of a test - the setup.

I call this "the scaffolding".

Here's what I need:
1) screen dump and a reader of these dumps, so I can fkn see what I'm doing - DONE, MANUALLY TESTED
2) a recorder of input, so I can replay what happened - DONE
3) a way to generate test environments quickly and keep them. I have fake filesystem, but it takes way too much time to
    write stuff to it, so I will make it initialize from a real filesystem - DONE, but not tested
4) a smart way to inspect state at the end of the test. I figured out I can query the "dump" for pieces that are
    focused, highlighted or marked in some other smart way. - DONE, TESTED
5) put item into tick?
