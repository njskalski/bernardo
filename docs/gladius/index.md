# Gladius Documentation

## Abstract

This is a high level documentation of a work-in-progress project. It may be occasionally outdated and is by no means
final. Furthermore, it will refer to code a lot, especially for definitions of file formats or communication protocols.
Intermediate knowledge of Rust is therefore assumed.

## Subjects

- [Config and default keybindings](./default_keymap.md)
- [High level project descrition](mission.md)
- [Workspace](./workspace.md)
