While implementing SaveFileDialog, following constraints were identified:

1) Layout requires access to SubWidgets to know their min-size.
2) Layout requires OutputSize produces list of Rects, that will contain only, but possibly not all SubWidgets from layout.
3) These Rects produce FocusGroup.

So:

Layout + Widget + OutputSize => Rects + FocusGroup
FocusGroup + Rects + InputEvent => Update.
