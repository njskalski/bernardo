# Bernardo/Gladius Documentation Guide

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for both Bernardo TUI and Gladius. While Bernardo TUI serves as a text user interface library, Gladius stands as the code editor built upon it. Currently, they share a single repository but plans to separate them are on the horizon.

Our aim with this guide is to offer an in-depth understanding of the projects, their features, and intricate topics. Whether you're a novice contributor or a seasoned team member, this documentation is tailored to provide valuable insights and direction.
