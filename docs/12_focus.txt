It ocured to me, that maybe focus should not be stored in widgets.

Maybe the widgets should just return the rects of not-blocked (by hover), receiving objects, and user should be able to
move "focus" between a flattened collection of those?

I mean, after all I have the invariant they do not occlude.

This would fix the paradox, when two rows and two columns do not enable the focus to move "circularly" around, as long
as the focus is stored in view.

If we move the focus to flattened structure, that would play really nice with idea of "anchor" or "special cursor".

It could lead to issues in situation like this

*--------*---------*---------*
|        |                   |
|        |                   |
|        *---------*---------*
|        |         |         |
|        |         |         |
*--------*---------*         |
|                  |         |
*------------------*---------*

where middle rectangle is hard to access in flat hierarchy.
But it's also impossible to define with current layouts.

So focus path is defined only in terms of:

User "looks at" XY, and path of escalation is defined only by "parent" relation.

This is completely different than how it is implemented right now (24 may)
so it will most likely not hit alpha.

Another requirement to keep in mind if "set focus" that needs to succeed even if called BEFORE the redraw (meaning it
can be poiting to something that hasn't been drawn yet), but it would be great if there was a fallback (in case focus is lost).
