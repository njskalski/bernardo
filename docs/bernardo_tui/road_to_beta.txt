Here is what I want to be present in Gladius Beta:

5)
git filtering in:
[DONE]    - file search
    - full text search

13) [done] ctrl-h - hidden files

7)
Code "collapsing"

8)
copy-cut-paste and context bar in tree!

Nice to haves (only if they turn out to be low hanging fruits):

10)
Tests:
save as:
    - error handling in save (failed write, disappearing dir etc)
    - changes the path to new in consecutive save as
Fuzzy file search
Resize event (start in crossterm_input.rs)

Docs:
1) how views work
2) how main loop works
3) how filesystems are implemented

Nice to haves:
1) tree view desc path should name expanded path

DESCOPED:
11) validate invariants
12) I'd love to see SubwidgetPointer refactored to SubwidgetPointerOp and handling of "non found subwidget"
3) USER FOCUS STACK
14) debug
