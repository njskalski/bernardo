Why on_input() is different from update():

The reason for it is that a widget can be updated not only by input, but these 3 scenarios:
1) user input
2) out-of-user input (filesystem change on SaveFileDialog or sth like this)
3) in reaction to Msg emitted by child widget (result escalation akin to unwinding the stack).
