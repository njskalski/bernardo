There will be maaaany widgets handling input.

There will be a simple input (single cursor) and THE INPUT (editor one).

I will implement simple input in editbox, maybe that's going to be enough. If not, the code from there
needs to be extracted into some reusable sub-component.

The big input has to be implemented in reusable way, because I want full powers of edition in both code editor
where all the magic (coloring, autocomplete etc) are available, but also in say a chat window implemented by some
plugin.
