make input handling reusable
    There will be maaaany widgets handling input.

    There will be a simple input (single cursor) and THE INPUT (editor one).

    I will implement simple input in editbox, maybe that's going to be enough. If not, the code from there
    needs to be extracted into some reusable sub-component.

    The big input has to be implemented in reusable way, because I want full powers of edition in both code editor
    where all the magic (coloring, autocomplete etc) are available, but also in say a chat window implemented by some
    plugin.

//TODO
     change every new_idx < sth.size() - 1  => to => new_idx + 1 < sth.size() to avoid underflow if sth.size is 0
