A reoccuring pattern of "data provider" for widgets appeared in both:

- ListWidget
- FuzzyWidget

but is not present in:

- TreeViewWidget

I think it's time to standarise the way data is delivered to widgets.

So there are two things to consider:

- performance
- ownership

First brings two things:

1) we don't want to reallocate unless contents dynamically change. No allocations on display.
2) no 'async' allowed in display. If we're waiting for output from different thread, we do a non-blocking poll.

Ownership:

3) widgets have to *own* a provider. Provider can be Arc<> of something, but Arc<RwLock<>> introduces risks of delay.
Channel + Cell cache (internal mutability) is safer.

A common situation is that I offer *immediate visual feedback* to user action while additional contents are still being
loaded (search in files, fuzzy search, pulling definitions from remote server etc).

So I have a feeling that a providers should offer at least "is_complete" call, so I can indicate load.
