If you see this on github, then it's a manual sync mirror that I often forget to push to.
The up-to-date version is at https://gitlab.com/njskalski/bernardo

This project is of a commandline, keyboard-only widget library called Bernardo TUI.

The priorities are:
- Unparalleled user experience
- Practical, non restrictive API

Secondary priorities: (to be targeted later)
- Performance
- Zero/almost zero panics

It's primary use case against which it will be tested is another approach to code editor (I try to write one since 2018).

Inspiration for name:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Gui

Bernardo Gui, an inquisitor, historian and for a period of time, Bishop of Tui :D. Portrayed as violent, unfair man in
"The Name of the Rose" novel by Umberto Eco. Some sources claim that this image is overly negative.

I consider using mouse for programming a heresy, so I figured I need a help from professional inquisition that no one
expects.

Presently it compiles to a binary, where I test any widget I currently work on.

I will write more docs, when the library matures a little more.
